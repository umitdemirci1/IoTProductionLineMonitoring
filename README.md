Smart Production Line Monitoring System

The Smart Production Line Monitoring System is a real-time data tracking solution designed to monitor sensor data from IoT devices on a production line. This project utilizes an ASP.NET Core Web API backend and a React frontend with SignalR to provide live updates on sensor data through interactive charts.
Features

    Real-Time Monitoring: Live tracking of sensor data (e.g., temperature, energy consumption, vibration) displayed on dynamic charts.
    SignalR Integration: Real-time communication between the backend and frontend for seamless data streaming.
    Multi-Sensor Support: Monitor data from multiple sensors, categorized by type.
    Customizable Data Views: Easily filter and visualize specific sensor data.
    Scalable Architecture: Backend API capable of handling a growing number of sensors and data points.

Tech Stack
Backend

    ASP.NET Core Web API:
        Mock data generation for sensors.
        SignalR for real-time data communication.
        Extensible structure for integrating database support (e.g., SQL Server).

Frontend

    React:
        Dynamic charts created with react-chartjs-2 and chart.js.
        Real-time updates via SignalR.

Database

    (Planned) SQL Server for persistent data storage.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites

    Node.js (16.x or later)
    .NET SDK (7.0 or later)

Backend Setup

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/umitdemirci1/smart-production-line.git

cd smart-production-line/backend

Restore dependencies and build the project:

dotnet restore
dotnet build

Run the API:

    dotnet run

        The API will run on http://localhost:5001 by default.

Frontend Setup

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

    npm run dev

        The React app will run on http://localhost:5173 by default.

Usage
Viewing Real-Time Data

    Start the backend API.
    Open the React app in your browser.
    Watch real-time sensor data visualized in charts.

Adding New Sensors

To simulate new sensors:

    Add sensor details in the backend's mock data generator.
    Restart the backend to include the new sensors.

Planned Enhancements

    Persistent Storage: Add SQL Server to save and retrieve historical sensor data.
    Advanced Analytics: Include statistical summaries and anomaly detection.
    Customizable Alerts: Notify users of unusual data patterns.
    Export Feature: Allow users to export data in CSV or Excel format.
